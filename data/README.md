# README

These data were processed by JS Stewart (now Lowndes, github: @jules32) in 2012-2013, in Matlab. Processing included combining different data sources into a single data frame and calculations by JS Stewart. Matlab scripts forthcoming; they are horrendous and dependent on local filepaths because I was teaching myself to program at the same time.

They were copied into the range-expansion-modeling repo in March 2017. 


Column headers are as follows (parentheses indicate data source):

- **UniDiveNum**: Unique dive number. Whole number is how dives are listed by MBARI, decimal indicates the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) used. .1=Ventana, .2=Tiburon, .3=Doc Ricketts (MBARI).
- **Squid**: calculated Humboldt squid relative abundance (in units of sightings by ROV per hour as described in Stewart et al. 2014) (MBARI)
- **DepthOMZ**: calculated upper depth of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), defined as 0.5 ml/L (MBARI)
- **Temp25m**: calculated temperature at 25m (MBARI)
- **UIwin**: calculated upwelling window XXXXXXXXXXX
- **NOI**: XXXXXX
- **DayL**: calculated day length
- **Strat**: calculated stratification
- **LatN**: latitute north
- **Hake**: calculated Hake relative abundance (in units of sightings by ROV per hour) (MBARI)
- **Loligo**: calculated Hake relative abundance (in units of sightings by ROV per hour) (MBARI)
- **Myct**: calculated Myctophid relative abundance (in units of sightings by ROV per hour) (MBARI)
- **SqMonth**: calculated 12-month year defined from March (3) - Feb (14) (MBARI)
- **SqYear**: year of study period from 1996-2011 (MBARI)
- **Distkm**: calculated distance offshore from the continental shelf (MBARI) 
- **ROV_ID**: ROV identifer: 1=Ventana, 2=Tiburon, 3=Doc Ricketts (MBARI).
- **SquidCount**: raw count of Humboldt squid per dive (MBARI)
- **Effort**: raw effort (length of the ROV dive, in hours)
- **PDO**: Pacific Decadal Osciliation (NOAA)
- **NPGO**: North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NOAA) 
- **LonW**: longitude west      
- **DepthOLZ**: calculated upper depth of the oxygen limited zone (OMZ), defined as 20 mol/kg (MBARI)
- **tcline**: calculated thermocline depth
- **tcstren**: calculated thermocline strength
- **tcval**: calculated thremocline value
- **tcoxy**: calculated oxygen at the thermocline 
- **ocline**: calculated oxycline depth
- **ocval**: calculated oxycline value     
- **ocstren**: calculated oxycline strength
- **octemp**: calculated temperature at the oxycline
