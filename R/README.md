# README

These scripts were written in 2012 by: 

- JS Stewart (now Lowndes, github: @jules32)
- JC Field

They have been updated March 2017 with the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org) and better coding practices. 

Provenance notes (Admittedly minimal): 

- `lavaanSEM.r` was renamed from its original `lavaanSEM_squid_2013_04_04.r`.
- `prepared_squid.RData` was renamed from its original `mysquid.RData`
